            Adventures are some of the moments in life, which makes our heart pump faster and gives us the feeling of being alive and full.
            It is an exciting experience very different from our normal daily routine. The adventure also brings with it a certain amount of risk. 
            It brings thrill with it, and we can feel the wind rushing. Some people love adventures and live for them. Others use it as a means of
             escape from their normal lives. Whatever be the reason, adventure makes people feel great about being able to live those moments
